# AI-Fuzzer

This script is designed as an educational tool to demonstrate web application fuzzing and potential vulnerabilities in web applications. It uses the Scrapy framework to crawl a specified website, extracting URLs and utilizing the OpenAI API to generate simulated attack payloads that are then sent to these URLs. The intention is to identify how different systems might respond to advanced payloads, helping in understanding and strengthening web application security.

## Purpose:

The purpose of this tool is purely educational. It is meant to provide cybersecurity students, educators, and professionals with a practical insight into the basic workings of web fuzzing and the automation of security testing techniques.

## Features

- **Web Spidering**: Automatically discovers accessible endpoints of a web application.
- **AI-Driven Payload Generation**: Uses OpenAI's GPT models to generate intelligent fuzzing payloads.
- **Dynamic Payload Refinement**: Adjusts fuzzing strategies based on the responses from the target application.
- **Automated Testing**: Supports automated batch testing of multiple endpoints.
- **Graceful Termination**: Allows the user to stop the scan at any time by pressing CTRL+C, ensuring that all data is safely written and no results are lost.
- **Results Logging**: Successful attack vectors are logged both in the terminal and to a structured text file for further analysis.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Scrapy
- Requests
- OpenAI Python client

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up AI-Fuzzer on your machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-fuzzer.git
   cd ai-fuzzer
   ```

2. **Install required Python packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install scrapy requests openai
   ```

3. **Set up OpenAI API key:**

   Ensure you have an OpenAI API key and set it as an environment variable:

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
   ```

## Usage

To use AI-Fuzzer, follow these steps:

1. **Run the script with the target URL as an argument:**

   ```bash
   python ai-fuzzer.py http://example.com
   ```

   Replace `http://example.com` with the URL of the web application you have permission to test.

2. **Review the output:**

   The script will output the progress and results of the fuzzing process to the terminal. To stop the scan, simply press CTRL+C.

3. **Check the log file:**

   Successful attacks will be logged in `successful_attacks.txt`, providing a detailed record of each successful payload and the corresponding URL.
